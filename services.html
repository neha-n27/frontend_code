    Gen AI Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, in
    cluding text, imagery, audio and synthetic data.
    <p>
        The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.
      The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. 
      But it was not until 2014, with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine learning algorithm -- that generative AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real people.
    </p>
     <p>On the one hand, this newfound capability has opened up opportunities that include better movie dubbing and rich educational content.
        It also unlocked concerns about deepfakes -- digitally forged images or videos -- and harmful cybersecurity attacks on businesses, including nefarious requests that realistically mimic an employee's boss</p>

    <p>RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. </p>
    <P>    Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. </P>
    <p>RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.</p>

    Converstaional AI Examples of conversational AI currently in use include:
    <br>
    Voice assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri that interact via voice AI
    <br>
    Virtual assistants, such as Microsoft’s Cortana
    AI powered chatbots
    <br>
    However, not all conversational AI initiatives are created equal. Results have shown that those with the highest success rate are more strategic in their development and deployment than their rush-to-market peers. By first asking thoughtful questions—like, “What are your goals?” “Are you looking to give more information to your web visitors?” <br>
    “Are you looking to generate leads?”—organizations can tailor the technology to their needs rather than rely on “plug-and-play” solutions.
    As the technology continues to advance, <br>new opportunities to leverage conversational AI continue to emerge. Future conversational AI applications already in development include home automation, automobiles, marketing, advertising and e-learning. As our exposure to and appetite for interactive technology increases, conversational AI will play a bigger and bigger role in our everyday lives
